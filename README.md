# Project Title
BikeShare Data Analysis

### Date Created
October 4, 2024

### Description
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree and focuses on analyzing BikeShare data. The analysis helps in understanding how people use BikeShare systems in different cities, exploring data trends such as the most popular times of travel, user demographics, and trip durations.

### Files Used
- `bikeshare.py`: Python script to analyze and display statistics from the BikeShare dataset.
- Data files: 
  - `chicago.csv`
  - `new_york_city.csv`
  - `washington.csv`


### Project Goals
The purpose of this project is to explore data related to BikeShare systems in three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Through this analysis, we aim to achieve the following goals:
- Understand the most popular times for bike rentals, including the busiest month, day of the week, and hour of the day.
- Explore user demographics and usage patterns, including breakdowns by user type (customer or subscriber), gender, and birth year.
- Provide insights into trip durations and popular stations for starting and ending trips.
- Identify trends that can help city planners and BikeShare services improve their systems.
